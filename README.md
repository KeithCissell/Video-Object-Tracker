# Video-Object-Tracker
This is a group project for CSC 645 - Computer Speech, Music and Images through Missouri State University.

This project will allow a user to track a selected object in a video. The user will first select a portion of a still video frame, the tracker will then attempt to find the selected object in each frame of the video using various recognition algorithms.
